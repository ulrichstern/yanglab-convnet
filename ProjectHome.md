This project enables analyzing animal behavior via classifying each video frame using convolutional neural networks.  The project has two parts.  First, it extends [cuda-convnet](http://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/) with two additional image transformations for data augmentation.  Second, it has several Python "scripts" for different aspects of the behavior analysis.
